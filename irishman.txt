Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) is a man who paints houses, with blood. Not literally — it’s mafia slang — but he’s a man who does jobs and cleans up after them, tossing telltale guns into an oil-dark river at nighttime, washing his hands and moving on. “I heard you paint houses,” says union boss Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), one day. “The Irishman” is long, to be sure, but it’s never less than compelling — Scorsese, De Niro, Pacino and Pesci, all in their mid-to-late-70s, are each carrying a lifetime of work, with practiced ease.This is, of course, familiar territory for Scorsese, who’s made numerous films exploring the world of organized crime; no one’s better at showing us a cavalcade of men with leathery voices and averted eyes, following them down dark hallways and sidewalks, sitting with them in dusty-lit Italian restaurants or startlingly ordinary middle-class living rooms, watching as fat envelopes get slid across a desk’s well-worn surface by gold-ring-adorned hands. Mobster after mobster crosses paths with Sheeran and Hoffa; Scorsese shows us, in onscreen notes, their eventual fate. With one exception (a man “well liked by all,” who died of natural causes), all met violent ends — a reminder, in case we’re finding this movie too entertaining, of prices paid.
